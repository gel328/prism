//
// Two jobs, both deliberately incremental:
//
//   • reapPendingRegistrations — deletes accounts that started the invite
//     flow and never finished it, freeing the username they hold.
//   • reapDissolvedTeams — finishes the staged dissolution a site admin
//     began, deleting the accounts a team minted and then the team row.
//
// Neither can run as a single statement. A team at the scale this feature
// exists for may anchor thousands of accounts, and every `DELETE FROM users`
// fans out across ~25 cascading tables; doing that in one request would
// exceed both the Worker CPU budget and D1's per-request statement ceiling.
// So each tick does a bounded slice and leaves the rest for the next one.
